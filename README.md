# Go-Neural-Network

Deep neural network for the game of Go, v1

This is my first AI project, and it will be an AI that plays the game of Go on a 9x9 board (for some relative simplicity). I won't use any remotely neural network related libraries, it will all be done from scratch with maths alone.
The neural network will be trained using a genetic algorithm that pits 256 versions against each other in a tournament, where the best 16 will be cloned (and altered), and the rest discarded.
If this goes well I'll make a version for the full 19x19 board, that is if a) the process isn't too dificult, and b) the AI isn't absolutely terrible after many iterations.
